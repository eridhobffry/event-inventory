# Multi-Event Support Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented multi-event support for EventForge Inventory system. Users can now create multiple events, each with its own isolated inventory, and switch between them seamlessly.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes ✅

**File: `prisma/schema.prisma`**

Added new models:

- **Event**: Stores event details (name, description, dates, location, creator)
- **EventMember**: Junction table for user-event relationships with role support

Modified existing models:

- **Item**: Added `eventId` foreign key and relation
- **AuditLog**: Added `eventId` foreign key and relation

### 2. Database Seed Update ✅

**File: `prisma/seed.ts`**

Updated to create sample data:

- 2 sample events (Jam Karet Festival, Pasar Hamburg)
- 3 event memberships demonstrating owner/member roles
- Event-specific inventory items
- Event-scoped audit logs

### 3. Backend API ✅

#### Middleware

**File: `backend/src/middleware/eventAccess.ts`**

- `verifyEventAccess`: Validates user has access to requested event
- `verifyEventOwner`: Ensures user is event owner for privileged operations
- `optionalEventAccess`: Non-failing event validation
- Supports `x-event-id` header or `eventId` query parameter

#### Routes

**File: `backend/src/routes/v1/events.routes.ts`**

- `GET /api/v1/events` - List user's events
- `GET /api/v1/events/:id` - Get single event
- `POST /api/v1/events` - Create new event
- `PUT /api/v1/events/:id` - Update event (owner only)
- `DELETE /api/v1/events/:id` - Delete event (owner only)

**File: `backend/src/routes/v1/eventMembers.routes.ts`**

- `GET /api/v1/events/:eventId/members` - List members
- `POST /api/v1/events/:eventId/members` - Add member (owner only)
- `DELETE /api/v1/events/:eventId/members/:userId` - Remove member (owner only)

**Updated Routes:**

- `backend/src/routes/v1/items.routes.ts`: Now filters by eventId
- `backend/src/routes/v1/audit.routes.ts`: Now filters by eventId

**Server Registration:**

- Updated `backend/src/server.ts` to register new routes and Swagger tags

### 4. Frontend Implementation ✅

#### Context & State Management

**File: `frontend/contexts/EventContext.tsx`**

- Manages current event state
- Stores selection in localStorage
- Provides event list and current event to components
- Auto-selects first event if none selected

#### Hooks

**File: `frontend/hooks/useEvents.ts`**

- `useEvents()` - Fetch all user events
- `useEvent(id)` - Fetch single event
- `useCreateEvent()` - Create event mutation
- `useUpdateEvent()` - Update event mutation
- `useDeleteEvent()` - Delete event mutation

**File: `frontend/hooks/useEventMembers.ts`**

- `useEventMembers(eventId)` - Fetch event members
- `useAddEventMember(eventId)` - Add member mutation
- `useRemoveEventMember(eventId)` - Remove member mutation

**Updated Hooks:**

- `frontend/hooks/useItems.ts`: Now uses event context
- `frontend/hooks/useAudits.ts`: Now uses event context

#### API Client

**File: `frontend/lib/api.ts`**

- Updated to automatically include `x-event-id` header from localStorage
- Created axios-like `apiClient` for easy integration
- No external dependencies required

#### Components

**File: `frontend/components/Navbar.tsx`**

- Added event selector dropdown
- Displays current event
- Quick "Create Event" action
- Integrates with event context

#### Pages

**File: `frontend/app/events/page.tsx`**

- Lists all user events
- Shows event role badges (Owner/Member)
- Displays event metadata (dates, location, members)
- Quick create button

**File: `frontend/app/events/new/page.tsx`**

- Create event form
- Fields: name (required), description, start date, end date, location
- Auto-redirects to dashboard after creation

**File: `frontend/app/events/[id]/page.tsx`**

- Event details and settings
- Tabbed interface (Details, Members)
- Edit event info (owner only)
- View and manage members
- Delete event (owner only with confirmation)

**Updated Pages:**

- `frontend/app/dashboard/page.tsx`: Shows current event info, handles no-event state
- `frontend/app/providers.tsx`: Wrapped with EventProvider

## Key Features

### User Experience

1. **Event Switching**: Dropdown in navbar for quick event switching
2. **Event Management**: Full CRUD operations on events
3. **Role-Based Access**: Owner vs Member permissions
4. **Member Management**: Add/remove members (owner only)
5. **Event Context**: All inventory and audit operations scoped to current event
6. **No-Event State**: Friendly message with call-to-action when no event selected

### Security

1. **Event Access Control**: Middleware verifies user membership
2. **Owner-Only Actions**: Update, delete, and member management restricted
3. **Automatic Ownership**: Event creator automatically becomes owner
4. **Last Owner Protection**: Cannot remove last owner from event

### Data Isolation

1. **Scoped Queries**: All items and audits filtered by event
2. **API Key Access**: User-scoped keys access all their events
3. **Event Context Persistence**: localStorage maintains selection across sessions

## Next Steps

### Required Manual Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**

   ```bash
   cd /Users/eridhobufferyrollian/Documents/Project/event-inventory
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add_multi_event_support
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

2. **Update Backend Environment**

   - Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in backend/.env
   - Restart backend server: `cd backend && npm run dev`

3. **Update Frontend Environment**
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` points to backend
   - Restart frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev`

### Optional Enhancements (Future)

1. **MCP Routes Update**: Add event context support to AI/MCP endpoints
2. **Event Invitations**: Email-based member invitations
3. **Event Templates**: Pre-configured inventory templates for event types
4. **Event Dashboard**: Dedicated analytics per event
5. **Event Archive**: Archive old events instead of deleting
6. **Bulk Operations**: Move items between events
7. **Event Sharing**: Public read-only view for specific events

## Architecture Decisions

1. **User-Scoped API Keys**: Keys grant access to all user's events (simpler than per-event keys)
2. **localStorage for Context**: Persists event selection without backend state
3. **Auto-Select First Event**: Better UX than forcing manual selection
4. **Header-Based Event ID**: `x-event-id` header simplifies request structure
5. **Role Field for Future**: "owner"/"member" roles ready for permission expansion
6. **Cascade Deletes**: Deleting event removes all items, audits, and memberships
7. **No Event Guard**: Handled inline in components rather than separate guard component

## Known Limitations

1. **No Email Invitations**: Members must be added by user ID
2. **No Event Search**: All events shown in list (fine for MVP)
3. **No Event Categories**: All events treated the same
4. **No Event Templates**: Each event starts empty
5. **MCP Not Updated**: AI integration still needs event context support

## Summary

Successfully transformed EventForge from a single-inventory system to a multi-event platform. The implementation follows best practices with:

- Clean separation of concerns
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
- RESTful API design
- React context for state management
- Security at middleware level
- User-friendly error handling
- Responsive UI with shadcn/ui components

The system is now ready for users to manage multiple event inventories simultaneously while maintaining data isolation and role-based access control.
