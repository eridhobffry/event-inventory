# Mobile Testing Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for testing mobile responsiveness and usability of the EventForge Inventory application.

## üì± Touch Target Size Verification

All interactive elements should meet the minimum 44√ó44px touch target size recommended by Apple and Google.

### Critical Touch Targets

- [ ] All buttons in forms (min 44px height)
- [ ] Navigation menu items (mobile bottom nav: 56px)
- [ ] Icon-only buttons (Edit, Delete, Settings)
- [ ] Dropdown/Select triggers
- [ ] Switch toggles in forms
- [ ] Tab controls
- [ ] Modal close buttons

### Verification Method

1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Toggle device toolbar (Cmd+Shift+M)
3. Inspect element dimensions
4. Verify computed width/height ‚â• 44px

## üìù Form Usability on Mobile Keyboards

### Text Input Fields

- [ ] Inputs expand properly when keyboard appears
- [ ] Form doesn't scroll behind keyboard
- [ ] Submit button visible with keyboard open
- [ ] Autocomplete/autofill works correctly
- [ ] Next/Previous field navigation works

### Number Input Fields

- [ ] `inputMode="numeric"` triggers numeric keypad
- [ ] Decimal inputs show decimal keypad
- [ ] No autocomplete on date fields
- [ ] Spinners work on mobile

### Date Pickers

- [ ] Native date picker opens on iOS Safari
- [ ] Date format displays correctly
- [ ] `autoComplete="off"` prevents browser suggestions

### Select Dropdowns

- [ ] Native select opens properly
- [ ] Options are readable
- [ ] Multi-select works on mobile
- [ ] Search in select works (if applicable)

## üì¶ Modal/Dialog Scrolling Behavior

### Dialog Components

- [ ] Dialogs are scrollable when content exceeds viewport
- [ ] Header remains fixed while content scrolls
- [ ] Footer actions always visible
- [ ] No double scrollbars
- [ ] Pinch-to-zoom disabled in modals
- [ ] Close button always accessible

### Sheet Components (Mobile Menu)

- [ ] Sheet slides in from correct side
- [ ] Backdrop click closes sheet
- [ ] Content scrolls independently
- [ ] No body scroll when sheet is open
- [ ] ESC key closes sheet

## üß≠ Bottom Navigation

### Layout

- [ ] Bottom nav doesn't overlap page content
- [ ] 80px bottom padding on pages (pb-20)
- [ ] Safe area insets respected on iOS
- [ ] Icons and labels are readable
- [ ] Active state clearly visible

### Behavior

- [ ] Tap targets are large enough (56px min)
- [ ] No hover states interfere with touch
- [ ] Navigation persists across pages
- [ ] Active page indicator works

## üìè Horizontal Scrolling Prevention

### Page Layouts

- [ ] No horizontal scroll on 320px width
- [ ] Tables collapse to cards on mobile
- [ ] Images scale within container
- [ ] Long text wraps or truncates
- [ ] Cards don't exceed container width

### Common Issues to Check

- [ ] Fixed-width tables ‚Üí use `overflow-x-auto`
- [ ] Long unbreakable strings ‚Üí add `break-words`
- [ ] Images without max-width ‚Üí add `max-w-full`
- [ ] Flexbox items ‚Üí add `min-w-0` to prevent overflow

## üçé iOS Safe Area Insets

### iPhone X+ (Notch/Dynamic Island)

- [ ] Top content not hidden behind notch
- [ ] Bottom nav respects home indicator
- [ ] Full-screen modals respect safe areas
- [ ] Landscape orientation handles notch

### CSS Implementation

```css
/* Already implemented in bottom nav */
.safe-area-inset-bottom {
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
}
```

## üîÑ Landscape Orientation Handling

### Rotation Behavior

- [ ] Layout adapts to landscape
- [ ] Forms remain usable in landscape
- [ ] Navigation accessible in landscape
- [ ] No content cut off
- [ ] Modals fit in landscape viewport

### Breakpoints to Test

- Portrait: 375√ó667 (iPhone SE)

## üêõ Common Mobile Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Input Zoom on iOS

**Fix:** Ensure font-size ‚â• 16px on inputs

input {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

### Issue: 100vh includes address bar

**Fix:** Use CSS with fallback

```css
min-height: 100vh;
min-height: 100dvh; /* Dynamic viewport height */
```

### Issue: Click delay on iOS

**Fix:** Already handled by `-webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent`

### Issue: Scrolling feels sluggish

**Fix:** Add `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` (already in Tailwind)
